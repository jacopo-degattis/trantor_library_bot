# Trantor Library's Telegram Bot

## Description
A trantor library's telegram Bot written in Python using this [library](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)

## Deploying

If you would like to deploy this bot locally first download all the requirements typing: 

<code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>

After that you have to setup tor proxy network on your computer... To do so simply download tor Browser from their official [website](https://www.torproject.org/download/). At this point move in the tor's folder and type the following:

On windows:

<code>tor.exe –service install</code>

On Linux / Mac OSx:

<code>./tor –service install</code>

On linux based OS (Linux and Mac Osx) you can simply start the executable typing ./tor without installing it as a service

## My configuration

Right now the bot is hosted on Heroku, that is a free hosting platform for different types of bot or even web-applications. Here I downloaded a plugin that locally install tor proxy network.
